The term ‘robotics’ in itself is a very interesting field. I have always been fascinated by seeing robots around me and wondered how they are so self-sufficient. Within the robotic arm project, what captivates me is the integration of mechanics, electronics, and software, enabling the arm to make precise and accurate movements, similar to the human arm. Exploring this project would offer me insights into the future of automation and robotics, and I am eager to dive into the world of robotics through this project.
